# Build
The project is built with Gradle.

You may try to build it [using Gradle command line interface](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_command_line.html),
but I suggest you simply import it into [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and let the studio
do all the magic.
